Besides having a full view of the problem, two buttons, one for edit and the other to remove complements de window if the user needs to to any of these actions<br>
## 3. Finally, in the last screen, which is the main focus of the app, the user can fill the inputs to explain the problem he is asking for a solution, so the Help service can get tunned in of the problem.<br>
