# Explanation
## 1. On the first screen we'll have an overall of all current help calls<br>

Notice that you can order by alphabetic and reload, but since you click on any of the calls you can have a detailed description, leading to the second page.<br>
## 2. There are the descriptions displayed for your better understanding<br>

Besides having a full view of the problem, two buttons, one for edit and the other to remove complements de window if the user needs to to any of these actions<br>
## 3. Finally, in the last screen, which is the main focus of the app, the user can fill the inputs to explain the problem he is asking for a solution, so the Help service can get tunned in about the problem.<br>
